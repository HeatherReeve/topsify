## Day 1

We have so many features to crank out this quarter it's hard to know where to
begin. The app is going to start making suggested playlists based on _the
algorithm_ - think "top 10 danciest tracks" and so on. And then we've got
Topsify Wrapped coming up at the end of the year...

Take a look at `queries`. See `0-example.sql`? Here's what to do in the terminal
to make it run:

```bash
sqlite3 db/db.sqlite < queries/0-example.sql > reports/0-example.json
```

You can check the results of your query in `reports`.

**Bonus:**

Have a look at `lib/paginate.js` too - would be amazing to get that working.

Thanks!
