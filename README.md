# Topsify

Welcome to Topsify! We're a huge music streaming service with a global user base
and eye-watering amounts of data.

We're so glad you're here - corporate have been asking for reports, stats and
data, but the team is stretched thin at the moment trying to get the UI right.
We need you working on the database straight away.

The database is in SQL. Before you tackle the backlog, you should take some time
to get up to speed.
